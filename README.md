Firewall Application in C++
Overview
This project implements a basic firewall application in C++. The firewall processes network traffic based on a set of rules provided in a specific format. It evaluates whether the traffic should be allowed or denied, logs the results, and displays them in a command-line interface (CLI). The processed results are also saved in a .DAT file for later review.

Features
Rule-Based Filtering: Evaluates network traffic against predefined firewall rules.

Traffic Processing: Supports processing of traffic data from external files.

Result Logging: Logs results in a .DAT file for further analysis.

CLI Display: Displays processed results directly in the command-line interface.

Customizable Rules: Rules can be easily modified by editing the input text file.

File Descriptions
Input Files
Rules File
Contains the firewall rules in the following format:

css
Copy
Edit
[RULE NO] [FIELD] [VALUE] [DECISION]
RULE NO: Unique identifier for each rule.

FIELD: The traffic field to match (e.g., SRC, DST, PRO).

VALUE: The value or range of values to match (e.g., IP address, protocol).

DECISION: Specifies whether the traffic should be ALLOW or DENY.

Traffic File
Contains traffic data entries formatted as:

ruby
Copy
Edit
[SRC:source_IP;DST:destination_IP;PRO:protocol;DATA_IN_HEX_FORMAT][...]
SRC: Source IP address.

DST: Destination IP address.

PRO: Protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP).

DATA_IN_HEX_FORMAT: Traffic data represented in hexadecimal format.

Output File
Results File (results.dat)
After processing the traffic against the firewall rules, the results are output in a .DAT file with the following structure:

less
Copy
Edit
SRC: source_IP
DST: destination_IP
PRO: protocol
DECISION: ALLOW/DENY
RULE_NO: rule_number
Usage
Command-Line Syntax
Place the rules.txt and traffic.txt files in the same directory as the compiled program.

Run the firewall program with the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
./firewall rules.txt traffic.txt
rules.txt: The file containing firewall rules.

traffic.txt: The file containing network traffic data.

Result Display
After running the program, the processed traffic results will be written to results.dat.

The results will also be displayed directly in the command-line interface for immediate review.
